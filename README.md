# pn532-async
asyncio uart based driver for the pn532. This driver is designed for use with micropython on the esp32.

Note: Communication with the pn532 is via the uart interface.


## Status
Just the most basic features are implemented. The primary one is the reading of passive rfid cards.

## References

The code is heavily based on the Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID control library by Tony DiCola.
